  KSK_STORE_CLERK_ONE_DESC: "It is hard to call Yamaha-san's life interesting or unique - working at a music store was the only entertainment in her life. That was the case until she won a deadly struggle over Kessoku and became the sole leader of the country.\nAt first, Yamaha wasn't interested in what was happening in a new rogue state. Later, though, she saw an opportunity - an opportunity to control the land, to be its ruler. After conspiring with her co-worker, they successfully couped the quadrumvirate of Hitori Gotoh, Nijika Ijichi, Ryo Yamada, and Kita Ikuyo and installed their own dictatorship. As it usually happens, their tandem also broke very quickly - resulting in another coup and the death of Yamaha's last enemy...\n\nNow, she sits at the top of the throne, proudly looking upon the country she can truly call hers while trying to ignore the blood that was spilled and the tears that were cried.\n\nAfter all, everything comes at a cost, right?"
